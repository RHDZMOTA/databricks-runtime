# Databricks LTS Python Runtimes

This repository contains a simple python package `runtime` to facilitate
referencing the supported python libraries in the [long-term support
databricks runtimes](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html).

This should facilitate adding the LTS dependencies in external python projects,
specially when building python wheels.
